ThinkStats also uses python and pandas, so it will give you a way to practice general coding and visualization skills.                                                                   |

"The premise of this book, and the other books in the Think X series, is that if you know how to program, you can use that skill to learn other topics." |
| Introduction to Statistical Learning | http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ | Math behind machine learning                          | If you want to start getting familiar with the math behind machine learning, ISL will walk you through it.  The code is in R, but the theory present in the chapters doesn't depend too much on a coding langauge.                    |
| Elements of Statistical Learning     | https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ElemStatLearn/   | More math behind machine learning                     | ESL is a deep dive into the math behind machine learning.  It is similar to ISL, but goes further.                                                                                                                                    |

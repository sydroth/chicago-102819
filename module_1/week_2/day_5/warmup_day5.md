### Import packages 
`import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
 `
`import seaborn as sns`

### 1. Create fake data from normal distribution with 100 observations

`use numpy random.normal`

### 2. Plot a histogram to see the distribution using matplotlib

### 3.switch to seaborn and add a smooth distribution line on top of histogram 

### 4. add titles to plots and save them in your visualizations folder using python commands

### 5. Now let's create now a fake linear regression data
- create weights (only one here!) and noise (give 0.1 as std for noise) from random normal as well 
-  create a series y such that:
    y = weight*x + noise 

### 6. create a scatter plot of x to y
### 7. use seaborn to plot a regression line

<h1 align="center">Module 4 Assessment</h1>

## Overview

This assessment is designed to test your understanding of the Mod 4 material. It covers:

* Calculus, Cost Function, and Gradient Descent
* Extensions to Linear Models
* Time Series



Read the instructions carefully. You will be asked both to write code and respond to a few short answer questions.

### Note on the short answer questions

For the short answer questions please use your own words. The expectation is that you have not copied and pasted from an external source, even if you consult another source to help craft your response. While the short answer questions are not necessarily being assessed on grammatical correctness or sentence structure, do your best to communicate yourself clearly.


## Part 1: Calculus, Cost Function, and Gradient Descent [Suggested Time: 15 min]
---

![best fit line](visuals/best_fit_line.png)

The best fit line that goes through the scatterplot up above can be generalized in the following equation: $$y = mx + b$$

Of all the possible lines, we can prove why that particular line was chosen using the plot down below:

![](visuals/cost_curve.png)

where RSS is defined as the residual sum of squares:

$$ 
\begin{align}
RSS &= \sum_{i=1}^n(actual - expected)^2 \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - \hat{y})^2 \\
&= \sum_{i=1}^n(y_i - (mx_i + b))^2
\end{align}
$$ 

### 1. What is a more generalized name for the RSS curve above? How is it related to machine learning models?


```python
# Your answer here
```

### 2. Would you rather choose a $m$ value of 0.08 or 0.05 from the RSS curve up above?   What is the relation between the position on the cost curve, the error, and the slope of the line?


```python
# Your answer here
```

### 3. Using the gradient descent visual from above, explain why the distance between each step is getting smaller as more steps occur with gradient descent.


```python
# Your answer here
```

### 4. What is the purpose of a learning rate in gradient descent? Explain how a very small and a very large learning rate would affect the gradient descent.


```python
# Your answer here
```

## Part 2: Extensions to Linear Regression [Suggested Time: 20 min]
---

In this section, you're going to be creating linear models that are more complicated than a simple linear regression. In the cells below, we are importing relevant modules that you might need later on. We also load and prepare the dataset for you.


```python
import pandas as pd
import itertools
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
%matplotlib inline
import seaborn as sns
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import Lasso, Ridge
import pickle
from sklearn.metrics import mean_squared_error, roc_curve, roc_auc_score, accuracy_score
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression, LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
```


```python
data = pd.read_csv('raw_data/advertising.csv').drop('Unnamed: 0',axis=1)
data.describe()
```


```python
X = data.drop('sales', axis=1)
y = data['sales']
```


```python
# split the data into training and testing set. Do not change the random state please!
X_train , X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y,random_state=2019)
```

### 1. We'd like to add a bit of complexity to the model created in the example above, and we will do it by adding some polynomial terms. Write a function to calculate train and test error for different polynomial degrees.

This function should:
* take `degree` as a parameter that will be used to create polynomial features to be used in a linear regression model
* create a PolynomialFeatures object for each degree and fit a linear regression model using the transformed data
* calculate the mean square error for each level of polynomial
* return the `train_error` and `test_error` 



```python
def polynomial_regression(degree):
    """
    Calculate train and test errorfor a linear regression with polynomial features.
    (Hint: use PolynomialFeatures)
    
    input: Polynomial degree
    output: Mean squared error for train and test set
    """
    # // your code here //
    
    train_error = None
    test_error = None
    return train_error, test_error
```

#### Try out your new function


```python
polynomial_regression(3)
```

#### Check your answers

MSE for degree 3:
- Train: 0.2423596735839209
- Test: 0.15281375973923944

MSE for degree 4:
- Train: 0.18179109317368244
- Test: 1.9522597174462015

### 2. What is the optimal number of degrees for our polynomial features in this model? In general, how does increasing the polynomial degree relate to the Bias/Variance tradeoff?  (Note that this graph shows RMSE and not MSE.)
